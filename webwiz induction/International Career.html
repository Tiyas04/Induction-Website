            Sharma made his List A debut for West Zone against Central Zone in the Deodhar Trophy at Gwalior in March
            2005. Batting at number eight, he scored 31 not out as West Zone won by 3 wickets with 24 balls remaining.
            Cheteshwar Pujara and Ravindra Jadeja made their debuts in the same match. It was Sharma's unbeaten innings
            of 142 in 123 balls against North Zone at the Maharanna Bhupal College Ground in Udaipur in the same
            tournament that brought him into the limelight. He visited Abu Dhabi and Australia with the India A squad
            and was then included among India's 30-member probable's list for the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy
            tournament, although he did not make the final squad.

        </div>
        <div class="float">
            Sharma made his first-class debut for India A against New Zealand A at Darwin in July 2006. He scored 57 and
            22 as India won by 3 wickets. He made his Ranji Trophy debut for Mumbai in the 2006–07 season and scored 205
            off 267 balls against Gujarat. Mumbai went on to win the tournament with Sharma scoring a half-century (57)
            in his second innings in the final against Bengal.
        </div>
        <div class="float">
            Sharma has spent his entire domestic first-class career at Mumbai. In December 2009, he made his highest
            career score of 309 not out in the Ranji Trophy against Gujarat. In October 2013, upon the retirement of
            Ajit Agarkar, he was appointed team captain ahead of the 2013–14 season.

        <h3>Test matches</h3>
        <div class="float">
            In November 2013, during Sachin Tendulkar's farewell series, Sharma made his Test debut at Eden Gardens in
            Kolkata against West Indies and scored 177, the second-highest score on debut by an Indian to Shikhar Dhawan
            (187). He followed it up with 111 (not out) in the second Test at his home ground, the Wankhede Stadium in
            Mumbai.

        </div>
        <div class="float">
            Having been out of the Test team since 2017–18, Sharma went on the 2018–19 tour of Australia after he had
            earned a recall earlier. Chief selector M. S. K. Prasad said the reason for his recall was that his natural
            game suited the bouncy Australian pitches. Sharma played in the first Test in Adelaide, scoring 37 and 1 in
            an Indian victory. During the first Test, he sustained a minor injury which saw him miss the second Test in
            Perth. He recovered for the Boxing Day third Test at Melbourne and scored 63 (not out) to help India total
            443/7 and win both the Test and the series. After the third Test, Sharma had to return to India for the
            birth of his daughter.

        </div>
        <div class="float">
            In October 2019, in the third Test against South Africa, Sharma scored his 2,000th run and his first double
            century in Tests. He made 212 in the first innings of the match. Sharma was named as vice-captain of India's
            Test team during the tour of Australia in 2020, replacing Cheteshwar Pujara.
        </div>
        <div class="float">
            Sharma had a successful home series against England in 2021. Instrumental in his team's comeback after a
            defeat in the first Test at Chennai, he scored a century, one that The Guardian termed "deserves to be
            considered one of the greatest this century." He put on 167 runs with Ajinkya Rahane for the fourth wicket
            while making 161 runs in an innings that included 18 fours and two sixes. India went on to win the Test by
            317 runs. He top-scored for his side in both innings of the low-scoring third Test in Ahmedabad with scores
            of 66 and 25 contributing to his team's win. Sharma finished the series aggregating 345 runs, the most for
            India, at an average of 58. He went on to score his first overseas Test century on 4 September 2021 with an
            innings of 127 against England at The Oval, also reaching the milestone of 3,000 runs in Test cricket.
        </div>
        <div class="float">
            Sharma was appointed captain of India's Test team in February 2022, succeeding Virat Kohli, ahead of a
            two-match series against Sri Lanka. Sunil Gavaskar praised his leadership and Chetan Sharma, India's
            chairman of selectors, said: "We will groom future captains under him".

        </div>
        <div class="float">
            In March 2015, Sharma made his first appearance in the Cricket World Cup and played in eight matches for
            India in the 2015 tournament in Australia. India reached the semi-final stage where they were defeated by
            Australia. Sharma scored 330 runs in the tournament with one century, a score of 137 in the quarter-final
            against Bangladesh.

                alt="Rohit in 2019 WC">
        </div>
        <div class="float">
            On 15 April 2019, Sharma was appointed vice-captain of India's squad for the 2019 World Cup in England. In
            the opening match against South Africa, he scored 122, including his 12,000th run in international cricket.
            He followed it up with centuries against Pakistan, England and Bangladesh. In the match against Sri Lanka,
            hitting yet another century, he became the first batsman to score five centuries in a single World Cup
            tournament, and equalled Tendulkar's record for the most centuries (6) in all World Cup matches. Sharma
            totalled 648 runs in the tournament to finish as the leading run-scorer and win the ICC's Golden Bat award,
            the third Indian player to do so.

        </div>
        <div class="float">
            On 8 October 2023, during the ICC Cricket World Cup, Sharma was entrusted with the captaincy
            responsibilities for the Indian team in a match against Australia. This significant moment marked the first
            time he captained the Indian side in the Cricket World Cup. What set this particular event apart was that at
            that time, he had become the oldest player to lead the Indian team in the tournament, showcasing his
            maturity and experience as a cricketer.
            <div class="imagetype1">

        <div class="float">
            On 11 October 2023, during a match against Afghanistan in the Cricket World Cup 2023, Sharma achieved a
            milestone by surpassing the Sachin Tendulkar's record for the most centuries in World Cup history. With a
            display of batting prowess, Sharma notched his seventh century, breaking the record in this World Cup
            encounter.
        </div>
        <h3>Other one-day international matches</h3>
        <div class="float">
            Sharma made his full international debut in a one-day match against Ireland in Belfast on 23 June 2007. This
            was part of the 2007 Future Cup competition which also involved South Africa. He was number seven in the
            batting order but did not bat as India won the game by 9 wickets.
        </div>
        <div class="float">
            He scored his maiden ODI half-century (52) against Pakistan at Jaipur on 18 November 2007 and was selected
            for the Indian squad going to the 2007–08 Commonwealth Bank Series in Australia. In that series, he scored
            235 runs at an average of 33.57 with 2 fifties, including 66 in the first final at Sydney when he partnered
            Sachin Tendulkar for most of India's successful run chase. After that, however, his ODI performances
            suffered a downturn and he lost his middle-order position to Suresh Raina. Later, Virat Kohli took his
            position as the reserve batsman. In December 2009, following his triple century in the Ranji Trophy, he was
            recalled to the ODI team for the tri-nations tournament in Bangladesh as Tendulkar opted to rest in the
            series.
        </div>
        <div class="float">
            He scored his maiden ODI century (114) against Zimbabwe on 28 May 2010 and followed it up with another
            century in the next match of the tri-series against Sri Lanka on 30 May 2010 by scoring 101 not out. He had
            a run of poor form in South Africa just before the 2011 World Cup and as a consequence he was left out of
            India's squad for the tournament.
        </div>
        <div class="float">
            Sharma was recalled to the limited-overs squad for the tour of the West Indies in June and July 2011. In the
            first match at Queen's Park Oval, he scored 68 (not out) from 75 balls with three fours and a six. In the
            third match at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua, he scored a match-winning 86 off 91 balls after
            India had been reduced to 92 for 6.
        </div>
        <div class="float">
            He had a disastrous loss of form in 2012 and scored only 168 runs in the whole calendar year at the very low
            average of 12.92 with just a single half-century. Even so, his captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni showed faith in
            him, and his career was revived in 2013. Dhoni decided to move him up the batting order to open the innings
            with Shikhar Dhawan in the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy. The pairing was a success and India won the
            competition, defeating hosts England in the final.

        </div>
        <div class="float">
            His good form continued and, later in the year against Australia, he scored 141 (not out) in Jaipur. He
            followed that with 209 off 158 balls in Bangalore and established a then-world record for the most sixes
            (16) in a one-day international innings (since beaten by Eoin Morgan of England with 17). On 13 November
            2014, playing against Sri Lanka at Eden Gardens in Kolkata, Sharma broke the world record for the highest
            score in a one-day international innings with 264 from 173 deliveries.

        </div>
        <div class="float">
            In December 2017, India's captain Virat Kohli was rested for the series against Sri Lanka, in preparation
            for India's tour to South Africa, which began in the first week of January 2018. In his place, Sharma was
            appointed team captain and India under his leadership won the series 2–1, their eighth consecutive series
            win since defeating Zimbabwe in June 2016. Sharma also hit his third ODI double-century in this series,
            scoring 208 (not out) to extend his record of most ODI double-centuries by a player.
        </div>
        <div class="float">
            In September 2018, in the absence of many top players including regular captain Virat Kohli, Sharma led
            India to win the 2018 Asia Cup, where they defeated Bangladesh in the final.
        </div>
        <div class="float">
            On 12 January 2019, in the opening match against Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground, Sharma scored 133
            but it was in vain as India lost by 34 runs. It was his 22nd century in one-day internationals. At Delhi on
            13 March 2019, in the fifth and final match of a home series against Australia, Sharma scored 56 including
            his 8,000th run in one-day internationals. It was his 200th innings. In 2019, he scored the most runs in
            ODIs by any batsman, with 1,490 runs in the calendar year, including 7 centuries.
        </div>
        <div class="float">
            In November 2020, Sharma was nominated for the ICC Men's ODI Cricketer of the Decade award.
        </div>
        <div class="float">
            In July 2022, Sharma became the first Indian captain to lead their team to both T20I and ODI series wins in
            England. He became the 3rd Indian captain to win an ODI series in England, and the first since 2014.
        </div>
        <h3>Twenty20 international matches</h3>
        <div class="float">
            Sharma was included in the Indian squad for the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 and made his mark by scoring an
            unbeaten 50 from 40 deliveries against hosts South Africa in a must win Super Eight match. This enabled
            India to win the match by 37 runs and they went on to defeat Pakistan in the final, when Sharma scored 30
            (not out) from 16 deliveries.
        </div>
        <div class="float">
            On 2 October 2015, during the South African tour of India, Sharma scored 106 in the first Twenty20
            international at HPCA Stadium in Dharamshala. With that, he became the second Indian cricketer to have
            scored centuries in all three formats of international cricket.

        </div>
        <div class="float">
            In December 2017, in a series against Sri Lanka, Sharma scored the joint-fastest T20I century, in 35 balls,
            ending with 118 from 43 deliveries, equaling the record of David Miller. This was also his second century in
            Twenty20 internationals.

        </div>
        <div class="float">
            On 8 July 2018, during a series in England, Sharma became the second Indian batsman, after Virat Kohli, to
            score 2,000 runs in a Twenty20 international career. He was the fifth batsman worldwide to achieve the feat;
            the others besides Kohli were Brendon McCullum, Martin Guptill and Shoaib Malik. He also scored his third
            T20I century during this series, equaling the then-record for most T20I centuries, held by Colin Munro.
        </div>
        <div class="float">
            In March 2018, he led Team India to win the Nidahas Trophy under his captaincy. In November 2018, in a
            series against West Indies, he scored his fourth T20I century, creating a new record for the most centuries
            by a player in T20I cricket.
        </div>
        <div class="float">
            In November 2019, in the opening match of the series against Bangladesh, Sharma became the most-capped
            cricketer for India in T20Is, playing in his 99th match. In the next match of the series, he became the
            first male cricketer for India to play in 100 T20Is.
        </div>
        <div class="float">
            In November 2020, Sharma was nominated for the ICC Men's T20I Cricketer of the Decade award.
        </div>
        <div class="float">
            In July 2022, Sharma became the first captain in T20I history to lead their team to 14 consecutive
            victories.
        </div>
        <div class="float">
            With his participation in the 2022 T20 World Cup in Australia, Sharma became the only Indian cricketer to
            have played in every edition of the tournament since its inception in 2007.
        </div>
        <div class="float">
            On 27 October 2022, Sharma broke the record for most sixes by an Indian batsman in T20 World Cups,
            previously held by Yuvraj Singh, hitting his 34th six against Netherlands at Sydney Cricket Ground.
        </div>
        <div class="float">
            In May 2024, he was named as a captain in India's squad for the 2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup tournament. In
            June 2024, during a match against Ireland, Rohit Sharma achieved the milestone of hitting 600 sixes in
            international cricket across all formats. On 29 June 2024, Sharma led India to win the 2024 T-20 World cup
            after defeating South Africa in the finals. In the post-match press conference after the T20 World Cup
            victory, Sharma declared his retirement from T20s, while confirming that he would continue to represent
            India in ODIs and Test match formats.

            Sharma joined the Indian Premier League (IPL) in 2008 when he was signed by the Deccan Chargers franchise,
            based in Hyderabad, for the sum of US$750,000 a year. In the 2011 auction, he was sold for US$2 million to
            the Mumbai Indians. He scored his maiden IPL century in the 2012 tournament with 109 (not out) against the
            Kolkata Knight Riders. Whereas he scored his second IPL century in 2024 tournament with 105 (not out) off 63
            balls against the arch-rivals Chennai Super Kings but this came in a losing cause, this was his 1st century
            after 12 long years.

            Under his leadership, Mumbai has won the IPL in 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2020; they also won the former
            Champions League Twenty20 competition in 2013.

            Sharma has been one of the most successful players in the IPL as captain since 2013 of the Mumbai Indians,
            who have won the tournament five times under his leadership. He is one of seven players who have scored
            5,000 career runs in the competition. Sharma has 6472 runs with two century and 42 half centuries and is the
            fourth-highest run scorer after Virat Kohli (7,582), Shikhar Dhawan (6,769), David Warner (6,563). In 2024
            Sharma was sacked as the captain, in favour of Hardik Pandya, their new buy. This sparked massive
            controversy among the fans, and many were disappointed that Sharma was not put back as captain.
