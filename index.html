        </h1>
        <div class="float">
            Rohit Sharma is currently the captain of the Indian cricket team in red ball as well as the ODI format. He
            is the opener of the team as well. In the modern generation, he is considered to be one of the greatest
            opener. He came to the team as a leg spinner but late on became one of the dashing batsman in the world
            carrying the millions of hopes of the indians on his soldier. He's been the worldcup winning captain of the
            T20 world cup 2024, after which he retired from T20 cricket, and was also the part of the 2007 worldcup
